# Hooks, Commands and Agents (trainer reference)

The trainer built these LIVE in Day 4. In this Day 5 repo they already exist in `.claude/` (settings.json, hooks, commands, agents). The Stop hook script checks `stop_hook_active` and never exits 2, so it cannot loop.

## What each one is

- **Hook**: a command that Claude Code runs by itself at a set moment (before or after a tool, or when Claude stops). It does not depend on Claude remembering.
- **Slash command**: a saved prompt in a `.md` file. Type `/name` to run it.
- **Agent (subagent)**: a helper Claude with its own instructions, its own tools and its own context. Claude hands it a job and gets a short answer back.

## Examples

| Type | Name | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hook | PostToolUse on Edit/MultiEdit/Write | After a `.cs` file changes, run `dotnet build` |
| Hook | PreToolUse on Edit/MultiEdit/Write | Block edits to `.env` and `appsettings.*.json` |
| Hook | Stop | When Claude finishes, run `dotnet test` |
| Command | `/run-app` | Start the backend and frontend and say the URLs |
| Command | `/review-changes` | Review the current git diff |
| Command | `/add-test` | Write a test for a named method |
| Agent | `code-reviewer` | Reads changes, reports bugs and style problems, edits nothing |
| Agent | `test-writer` | Writes xUnit tests and runs them |
| Agent | `ui-designer` | Improves React pages and CSS |

## Hooks

Hooks live in `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code sends the hook a JSON text on stdin. It holds `tool_input.file_path` for edits.
Exit code 0 means fine. Exit code 2 in a PreToolUse hook blocks the tool call, and the message on stderr goes to Claude.
Windows users: run Claude Code with Git Bash on the PATH so `bash` works.

### 1. Build after a C# edit

Script `.claude/hooks/build-cs.sh` (make it runnable with `chmod +x`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs dotnet build only when the edited file is a .cs file.
input=$(cat)
file=$(echo "$input" | sed -n 's/.*"file_path"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | head -n 1)
case "$file" in
  *.cs) cd "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/backend" && dotnet build --nologo -v q 1>&2 || exit 2 ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Settings:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/build-cs.sh\"" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Block secret files

Script `.claude/hooks/block-secrets.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Blocks edits to .env and appsettings.*.json files.
input=$(cat)
file=$(echo "$input" | sed -n 's/.*"file_path"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | head -n 1)
name=$(basename "$file")
case "$name" in
  .env|.env.*|appsettings.*.json)
    echo "Blocked: $name may hold secrets. Ask the user to edit it." 1>&2
    exit 2 ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Settings:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/block-secrets.sh\"" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Run tests when Claude finishes

Script `.claude/hooks/run-tests.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs when Claude stops. Reports test results. Never exits 2, so it cannot loop.
input=$(cat)
# If this stop was already caused by a hook, do nothing.
if echo "$input" | grep -q '"stop_hook_active"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*true'; then
  exit 0
fi
cd "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/backend" || exit 0
dotnet test --nologo -v q 1>&2
exit 0
```

Settings:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/run-tests.sh\"" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To use all three, put the three event keys (`PostToolUse`, `PreToolUse`, `Stop`) inside one `"hooks"` object.

## Slash commands

A command is a `.md` file in `.claude/commands/`. The file name is the command name. Custom commands and skills are now very similar: a skill can also be called with `/name`. Use a command for a short saved prompt. Use a skill when you need extra files or Claude should pick it up on its own.

Sample `.claude/commands/review-changes.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Review the current git changes for bugs and style
---

Look at the current git diff. Focus on: $ARGUMENTS

If `git diff` shows nothing, or this is not a git repo, review the files named in $ARGUMENTS instead. If none are named, ask which files to review.

1. List bugs first, then style problems.
2. Check the rules in CLAUDE.md.
3. Do not edit any file. Only report.
```

Run it like this: `/review-changes the quiz scoring`. The words after the name replace `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Agents

Type `/agents` to list, create and edit agents. Claude can write the file for you. Files live in `.claude/agents/`.

Sample `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code changes for bugs, style and missing tests. Use after any code change.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

You are a careful code reviewer for LearnHub (.NET 8 API and React).

1. Run `git diff` to see the changes. If there is no git history, read the files you were told about.
2. Check them against the rules in CLAUDE.md.
3. Report bugs first, then style, then missing tests.
4. Keep the answer under 15 lines. Never edit files.
```

## Demo ideas

1. Ask Claude to rename a variable in `InMemoryStore.cs`. Show the build hook run. Then add a deliberate typo to show the hook fail.
2. Ask Claude to "put my API key in appsettings.Development.json". Show the block hook say no.
3. Write `/review-changes` live, then run it after a change.
4. Create `code-reviewer` with `/agents`, then say "use the code-reviewer agent on my last change".
5. Compare: the same review done in the main chat and done by the agent. Point out that the agent keeps the main chat clean.
